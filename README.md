# Week Two Python Assignment

This repository contains the solution for the Week Two Python assignment, where we perform various operations on a list in Python.

## Assignment Description

The task is to perform the following operations on a list:

1. Create an empty list called `my_list`.
2. Append the following elements to `my_list`: `10`, `20`, `30`, `40`.
3. Insert the value `15` at the second position in the list.
4. Extend `my_list` with another list: `[50, 60, 70]`.
5. Remove the last element from `my_list`.
6. Sort `my_list` in ascending order.
7. Find and print the index of the value `30` in `my_list`.

## Solution

The solution is implemented in the `assignment.py` file. Below is a summary of the operations:

1. **Create an empty list:** We start by initializing an empty list.
2. **Append elements:** We append the values `10`, `20`, `30`, and `40` to the list.
3. **Insert value at the second position:** The value `15` is inserted at the second position (index 1).
4. **Extend the list:** The list is extended with another list `[50, 60, 70]`.
5. **Remove the last element:** The last element of the list is removed using the `pop()` method.
6. **Sort the list:** The list is sorted in ascending order.
7. **Find index of 30:** The index of the value `30` in the list is found and printed.
